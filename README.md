# Disclaimer

This README is in progress. Nothing is final. Read at your own risk. The following sections are more for our own bookkeeping than for your eyes.

## Modifications to [SSD](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~wliu/papers/ssd.pdf) so far
 - Use [ResNet101](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) as a backbone
 - ~~Choose anchor boxes that better cover smaller objects~~
 - ~~Choose prediction layers that make more sense (compared to [SSD 321/513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06659.pdf))~~
 - ~~Use Prediction Modules (type c) from [DSSD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06659.pdf)~~
 - ~~Use [YOLOv2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf)-style coordinate regressions (which better fits our tiling scheme)~~
 - ~~*Upsample* images to between 600-1000px while maintaining aspect ratio (no fixed input sizes)~~

These changes really worked, didn't they? :/

# Installation
 - Set up a Python3 environment.
 - Install [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) 0.4.1 and TorchVision.
 - Install some other packages:
   ```Shell
   # Cython needs to be installed before pycocotools
   pip3 install cython
   pip3 install opencv-python pillow pycocotools matplotlib 
   ```
 - Clone this repository:
   ```Shell
   git clone https://github.com/dbolya/yolact.git

   # Enter it
   cd yolact
   ```
 - Download the COCO 2014 Dataset. Note that this script will take a while, spam your terminal, and dump 14+gb of files into `./data/coco`.
   ```Shell
   sh data/scripts/COCO2014.sh
   ```
 - Create the sets `trainval35k_` and `minival5k_` (this does not copy any images).
   ```Shell
   python data/scripts/mix_sets.py trainval35k train2014 : val2014 :35000
   python data/scripts/mix_sets.py minival5k val2014 -5000:
   ```


# Training
 - To train, grab a pretrained VGG16 or Resnet101 model and put it in `./weights`.
   * For VGG16, download `vgg16_reducedfc.pth` from [here](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch).
   * For Resnet101, download `resnet101_reducedfc.pth` from [here](http://vision5.idav.ucdavis.edu:6337/resnet101_reducedfc.pth).
 - Run one of the training commands below.
   * Note that you can press ctrl+c while training and it will save an `*_interrupt.pth` file at the current iteration.
   * All weights are saved in the `./weights` directory by default with the file name `<config>_<epoch>_<iter>.pth`.
```Shell
# Trains using the default config (whatever it is at the moment) and with batch size 32 (not advisable!)
python3 train.py

# Trains yrm10_config with a batch_size of 5 (suprise). For the 550px models, 1 batch takes up around 1.8 gigs of VRAM, so specify accordingly.
python3 train.py --config=yrm10_config --batch_size=5

# See data/config.py for a list of configs (they end with _config)
# Note that the --config paramater is eval'd so you can do clever stuff like
python3 train.py --config="yolact_resnet101_config.copy({'max_size': 600})" --batch_size=5

# Resume training config yrm10 with a specific weight file and start from the iteration specified in the weight file's name.
python3 train.py --config=yrm10_config --resume=weights/yrm10_10_32100.pth --start_iter=-1

# Use the help option to see a description of all available command line arguments
python3 train.py --help
```


# Evaluation
```Shell
# Quantitatively evaluate a trained model on the entire validation set
# Note: the config will be parsed from the model name. If you don't want that, specify a config with --config
python3 eval.py --trained_model=weights/yrm10_10_32100.pth

# Restrict the number of images evaluated to 100 (since the full validation set will take a while)
python3 eval.py --trained_model=weights/yrm10_10_32100.pth --max_images=100

# Output a COCOEval json to submit to the website or to use the run_coco_eval.py script
python3 eval.py --trained_model=weights/yrm10_10_32100.pth --output_coco_json

# Display qualitative results
python3 eval.py --trained_model=weights/yrm10_10_32100.pth --display

# See the help option for more details (there are a lot of extra command line arguments)
python3 eval.py --help
```
